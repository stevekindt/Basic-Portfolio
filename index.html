                    After working in the medical device industry for a number of years I decided that I wanted to find a
                    creative outlet
                    in my professional life. I thought that web design would be a good opportunity to exercise this
                    desire. I was also
                    drawn to the idea that the field is constantly changing with new technologies and frameworks
                    requiring non-stop learning.
                    After buying a few coding books and taking some free courses online, I decided to get serious and
                    invest in this new
                    path by enrolling in a coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.</p>
                    <p class="second">As a new web design student I am excited to begin my journey toward a challenging and rewarding profession.</p>
